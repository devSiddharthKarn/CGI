### C++ Graphics Engine: No Bloatware, Easy Handling

**Simple. Effective. Elegant.**

---

**CGI_PROJECT2082** is a lightweight C++ graphics engine designed for creating interactive graphical applications on Windows. Built from the ground up to teach graphics programming fundamentals, it provides direct pixel manipulation, window management, and input handling without heavy dependencies or complex abstractions.

**Note**:The author(me) was somehow tired of learning the new graphics api just for a single window on my screen,so i made this for others to get started with almost no boilerplate and minimum overhead.See main.cpp as an example to get Started:

Perfect for learning graphics programming, building small games, or prototyping visual applications.

## üéØ Overview

CGI (C++ Graphics Engine) offers a minimalist approach to graphics programming:

- **Direct Window Control** - Create and manage custom windows with full control over rendering
- **Pixel-Perfect Graphics** - Draw shapes, manipulate individual pixels, and render custom graphics
- **Responsive Input** - Handle keyboard and mouse events for interactive applications
- **Frame Management** - Built-in timing system for smooth animations and consistent FPS
- **Zero Dependencies** - Pure C++ with Win32 API, no external libraries required

**Current Demos:**

- **Flappy Rectangle Game** - A physics-based game demonstrating collision detection and game mechanics
- **Cursor Drawing Demo** - Real-time interactive graphics following mouse input

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Windows OS** (Win32 API required)
- **C++ Compiler** (MSVC recommended, MinGW compatible)
- **Visual Studio** or **VS Code** with C++ extension

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CGI_PROJECT2082.git
cd CGI_PROJECT2082
```

2. **Open in your IDE:**

   - Open the project folder in Visual Studio or VS Code
   - Ensure your C++ compiler is properly configured

3. **Build and run:**
   - Compile `main.cpp` for the Cursor Drawing Demo
   - Compile `cgi_collection.cpp` for the Flappy Rectangle Game

---

## üéÆ Demo Applications

### Flappy Rectangle Game

A simple physics-based game showcasing collision detection and game loop fundamentals.

**Controls:**

- `Space` - Jump
- `R` - Restart after game over

**Run:** Build and execute `cgi_collection.cpp`

### Cursor Drawing Demo

An interactive demo that draws a rectangle following your mouse cursor in real-time.

**Controls:**

- Move your mouse within the window

**Run:** Build and execute `main.cpp`

---

## üíª Quick Start Example

```cpp
// Your update function called every frame
#include "CGI/cgi_window.hpp"


cgi::window window("mywindowhello", 50, 50, 400, 400, cgi::color::rgb(90, 89, 78));

cgi::type::map2_t rectangle;
void start()
{

    rectangle.resize(400, cgi::type::map_t(600, '1'));

    window.create();
    window.show();
}

void update()
{
    window.clear();
    std::cout << window.fps() << '\n';
    window.draw_map2_t(window.get_cursor_x(), window.get_cursor_y(), rectangle, cgi::color::rgb(255, 0, 0));
}

int main()
{

    window.start_as(start);
    window.run_as(update, 30);
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

Please be aware of these limitations:

- **Windows Only** - Uses Win32 API exclusively; no Linux/macOS support yet
- **CPU Rendering** - Software-based rendering without GPU acceleration
- **Limited Primitives** - Currently supports rectangles and pixel drawing only
- **Single-Threaded** - All operations run on the main thread
- **No Resource Cleanup** - Manual memory management required in some cases
- **Minimal Error Handling** - Limited validation and error feedback
- **Basic Input** - No support for complex input patterns or gamepads

Despite these limitations, CGI provides an excellent foundation for learning graphics programming and building simple applications.
